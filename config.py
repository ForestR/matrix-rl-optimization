# Define Configuration Class:
#     Initialize with default settings for the project (e.g., learning rate, batch size, model architecture parameters)
#     Include configurations for environment (e.g., matrix sizes, operation types)
#     Include agent configurations (e.g., memory size for DQN, epochs for PPO)
#     Include paths for saving models and logging
