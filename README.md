# Reinforcement Learning for Optimized Matrix Multiplication

## Overview
This project applies reinforcement learning (RL) to discover efficient algorithms for matrix multiplication. By simulating a learning environment for matrix operations, RL agents are trained to minimize the number of operations required. The ultimate goal is to find strategies that outperform conventional algorithms on computational resources, focusing on leveraging the power of an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with PyTorch.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip package manager
- An NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support is recommended for training the models.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/matrix-rl-optimization.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   ```bash
   cd matrix-rl-optimization
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
5. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To start training an RL agent to optimize matrix multiplication, run:
```bash
python train.py
```
Adjust configurations in `config.py` to customize the training process.
