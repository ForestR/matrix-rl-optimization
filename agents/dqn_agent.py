# class DQNAgent:
#     Initialize:
#         - Neural network model for Q-value estimation
#         - Replay memory for experience replay
#         - Action selection strategy (e.g., epsilon-greedy)
#
#     Train:
#         - Sample a minibatch from replay memory
#         - Calculate target Q-values for the next state
#         - Update the network by minimizing the loss between target and predicted Q-values
#
#     Act:
#         - Select action based on current state using the action selection strategy
#         - Store transition in replay memory
#
#     Update Target Network:
#         - Periodically update the target network weights to stabilize training
