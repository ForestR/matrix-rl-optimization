# Import necessary libraries and modules (agents, environments, neural networks, config)
# Define training loop:
#     Initialize environment and agent as per configuration
#     For each episode:
#         Reset environment
#         While episode not done:
#             Agent selects action
#             Environment executes action, returns new state, reward, and done flag
#             Agent learns from the transition
#         Log episode results
#     Save trained model
